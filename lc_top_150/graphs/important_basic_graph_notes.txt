Graph: anything which have node and edges called graph 
2 types:
1. Directed: Contains a single direction edges
2. Adirected: Contains a Bidirectional edges 

Cycle: Anything which start from one and end at again at one is call a cycle 
2 Types:
1. UnDirected Cyclic Graph: Undirected graph which contains cycle 
2. Directed Acyclic Graph: No Cycles 

Path: Contains alot of nodes/vertex and each of them are reachable (node cannot appear twice in a path) 

Degrees: Number of edges attached to a vertex . 
Important Property: Total Degree of a Graph = 2 x Edge (Undirected Graph) 

Degrees of Directed Graph: 2 types Indegree and Outdegree 
Indegree: No. of incomming (goes inside the vertex) edges 
Outdegree: No. of outgoing(goes outside from the vertex) edges. 

Edge Weight: Weights assign to a particular edge (cost to travel from that edge) 
if no weights assign assume unit weight as 1
